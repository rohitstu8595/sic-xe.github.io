# ASCII Character Codes

Although ASCII is not SIC-specific, SIC uses the ASCII character set (it does
not support UTF-8).
When debugging a program that processes or interacts with text, it's useful to
know how that text is represented in memory, because then you can easily see
where the text is originally stored and how it is handled.
