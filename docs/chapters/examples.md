# SIC/XE Assembly Programs Explained

This chapter describes a few example SIC/XE assembly programs in detail.

Each example has three sections, which should be viewed in order.
The first section is the assembly code with minimal comments, like you would
see in pre-written programs or would write yourself.
The second section is the same assembly code, but commented line by line with
what each instruction does and possibly some extra information.
The last section explains what the program does and describes any additional
specifics that might be relevant.

The recommended approach to reading this chapter is to read the first section
of each example and try to understand what the code does by yourself.
With practice you can remember what each instruction does, but you can always
look at the [Instruction Set](instruction-set.md) or [Cheatsheet](cheatsheet.md)
side-by-side with the example.

If you think you understand what the program does, you can immediately skip to
the explanation to see if you were correct, otherwise see the second section
for a few hints.
